Aspect CLI
==========

Aspect CLI is a super-charged replacement for the Bazel CLI.

> Note: this documentation is also hosted at https://docs.aspect.dev/aspect-cli

High-level features:

- Fully compatible drop-in replacement for calling `bazel`.

- All the developer experience polish we can manage.
  The power of Bazel without the steep learning curve.

- Includes [bazelisk] so the version of the Bazel server is the same across
  developers and your CI.

- Plugin system allows extension by third-parties or your company.
  Plugins can do things like repair problems reported as errors,
  add new commands like `lint`, and much more.

  For more information about writing a plugin, run `aspect help plugins`.
