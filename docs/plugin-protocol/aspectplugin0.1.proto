// Aspect CLI Plugin RPC protocol version 0.1
//
// This file defines version 0.1 of the RPC protocol.
// To implement a plugin against this protocol, you could copy this file
// into your own codebase and use protoc to generate stubs for your target language.
// Alternatively, use the aspect CLI plugin template:
// https://github.com/aspect-dev/aspect-cli-plugin-example
//
// This file will not be updated. Any minor versions of protocol 0 to follow
// should copy this file and modify the copy while maintaing backwards
// compatibility. Breaking changes, if any are required, will come
// in a subsequent major version with its own separate proto definition.
//
// Note that only the proto files included in a release tag of Aspect CLI are
// official protocol releases. Proto files taken from other commits may include
// incomplete changes or features that did not make it into a final release.
// In all reasonable cases, plugin developers should take the proto file from
// the tag of the most recent release of Aspect CLI, and not from the main
// branch or any other development branch.
